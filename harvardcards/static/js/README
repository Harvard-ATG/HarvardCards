The *js* directory is organized as follows:

├── components/		Objects that package up functionality and services for views.
├── lib/			Third-party libraries (i.e. jQuery, etc)
├── mixins/			Objects with related functions that can be "mixed" into other objects via $.extend().
├── models/			Objects that model aspects of business logic without respect to the display.
├── modules/		Objects that fulfill the role of "controller" for a sub-tree of the DOM. See module-loader.js.
├── spec/			Unit tests or "specs" for objects. See Jasmine unit testing docs.
├── utils/			Utility objects and functions. 
└── views/			Object that controls the display and behavior element(s) in the DOM.

All libraries are intended to be used with AMD (requirejs) and follow basic MVC structure.
