This directory should be organized as follows:

js/
    controllers/ - Application controllers (MVC)
    lib/ - Third-party libraries such as jQuery, etc should go in here
    modules/ - Modules that encapsulate behavior within a particular section of the DOM. 
               These may require collaborations between many controllers, models, and views.
    mixins/ - Mixins are special utility objects with reusable functions that may be "mixed in" 
              with others via jQuery.extend() or _.extend().
    models/ - Application models (MVC). These encapsulation domain knowledge and behavior. 
    spec/ - Jasmine unit tests, known as "specs." Every object should have one or more specs. 
    utils/ - Well-defined utility objects and functions.
    views/ - Application views (MVC).
